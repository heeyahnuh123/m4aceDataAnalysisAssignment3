For the Logical function page:
- I compared Kevin Cookie Company and Mrs. Fields, 10 and 5, 
if 10 < 5, if 10 > 5, if 10 >= 5
- I used the "IF" function to check the cookie with the highest sales
and displayed it
- I used "AND" to check if chocolate chip sold more than all other 
cookies
- I used "OR" to check if chocolate chip sold more than oatmeal 
raisin or sugar
- I used "IFS" 

For the Lookup Functions page:
- I used VLOOKUP to return the price of each cookie
- I used XLOOKUP to return the price and cost of each cookie
- I used HLOOKUP to return a value in the first row

For the Date & Time page:
- I used "today" to get the current day
- I used "now" to get the current day and time
